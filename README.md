# Lexer-Design
A repository for designing and creating a compiler lexer using Flex and Makefile.

## Project Description
The purpose of this project is to design and implement a lexer for a compiler using Flex, a fast lexical analyzer generator. The lexer will be used to analyze source code and identify tokens, which can then be used by the parser to understand the structure of the code. The project will also make use of Makefile to automate the building and testing of the lexer.

## Project Content
The repository contains the following files:
- `lexer.l`: The Flex file that defines the rules for the lexer.
- `Makefile`: The makefile for automating the building and testing of the lexer.
- `source`: A test file used to verify the output of the lexer.
- `a.out`: The output file generated by the lexer when run on the test file.

## Requirements
To run this project, you will need to have Flex and a Make tool installed on your machine.

## Running the Project
To run the project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the root directory of the repository in the terminal.
3. Run `make` to build the lexer.
4. Run `./lexer source > a.out` to run the lexer on the test file.
5. Verify the output in `a.out`.
